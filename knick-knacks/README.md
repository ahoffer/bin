# Knick-Knacks

A collection of useful diagrams, scripts, and reference materials that don't fit neatly into other project structures but are too valuable to lose track of.

## Usage

These PlantUML diagrams can be rendered using:
- PlantUML extension in VS Code
- Online PlantUML server
- Local PlantUML installation

## Why This Directory Exists

This directory serves as a "digital junk drawer" for:
- Reference materials that don't belong in specific project repos
- Diagrams and documentation that might be useful across multiple projects
- Quick access to frequently referenced information
- Materials that would get lost in cloud storage or email

## Adding New Items

When adding new items to this directory:
1. Update this README with a description
2. Use descriptive filenames
3. Include any relevant context or usage notes
4. Consider if the item should eventually be moved to a more specific location
